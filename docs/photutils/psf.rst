PSF Photometry
==============

.. warning::
    The PSF photometry API is currently *experimental* and may change
    in the future.  For example, the functions currently accept
    `~numpy.ndarray` objects for the ``data`` parameters, but they may
    be changed to accept `astropy.nddata` objects.

For a demonstration of current PSF photometry capabilities please see
this `IPython notebook
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/astropy/photutils-datasets/blob/master/notebooks/PSFPhotometrySpitzer.ipynb>`_,
which can also be downloaded from `photutils-datasets
<https://github.com/astropy/photutils-datasets>`_.
